Package: python-petname
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Description: python library for generating pronouncable, memorable, pet names
 This package provides a library for generating "pet names", consisting
 of a random combination of an adverb, adjective, and proper name.
 These are useful for unique hostnames, for instance.
 The default packaging contains about 2000 names, 1300 adjectives,
 and 4000 adverbs, yielding nearly 10 billion unique combinations,
 covering over 32 bits of unique namespace.
 As such, PetName tries to follow the tenets of Zooko's triangle:
 names are human meaningful, decentralized, and secure.
